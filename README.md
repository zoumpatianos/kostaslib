Kostas utilities library
========================

Contains various bits of code that help me automate my work.

Automation
----------
*My tomato automation library which eases the process of creating workflow scripts.*

Data Analysis
-------------
*My numeric csv files plotter, which plots a set of CSV files in a set of diagrams (one for each column)
in order to visually inspect the differences between the data in them.*
